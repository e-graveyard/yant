## Who is it for?

Primarily, me. These _features_ are stuff that I've been sparsely using on my
private and public projects. It's better to just compile everything into
something ready-to-be-used.

It doesn't stop you, however, to use it for your own good. This is public
domain, so use it with or without notice.
